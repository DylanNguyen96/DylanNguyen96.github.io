Content discussed:

This initial meeting was held on Facebook as the availability of everyone in the group varies and a location and time for a physical meeting hadn't been completed yet.

In this meeting, myself (Michael Leontieff) asked for contribution to the feature lists from other teams whilst Kerwin completed the Team Agreement. After both of these items were completed they were put on the google drive so other members of the group could read/agree upon and sign the documents.

I also discussed the implementation phase, whereby I decided that Ruby on Rails would be a suitable web framework for building the proposed application. Since development is a few weeks off I asked the group for someone else to join me in the implementation phase for which Kerwin responded. I further explained my plans to him and will provide resources to him next team meeting to allow him to learn the framework alongside myself. This way we'll both be learning the ropes at the same time so by the time development starts we'll both be on the same page.
